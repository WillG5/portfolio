            <div id="mecha-content">
                <p>The RX-78-2 Gundam (aka the Gundam or White Mobile Suit) is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit
                    Gundam
                    anime. Part of the RX-78 Gundam series, it was built in secret on Side 7. The Gundam would turn the
                    tide
                    of war in favor of the Earth Federation during the One Year War against the Principality of Zeon.
                    The
                    unit was primarily piloted by the series' main protagonist Amuro Ray.</p>
                <p>The Gundam was incredibly advanced for its time. Built from lightweight Luna Titanium Alloy, its
                    frame
                    was both lighter than that of Zeon's mass-produced mobile suits and much sturdier, able to shrug off
                    a
                    MS-06 Zaku II's machine gun fire with little to no damage. Its offensive power was above and beyond
                    that
                    of the Zakus. The Gundam would engage in most battles with its beam rifle, making it the first
                    mobile
                    suit to have firepower equivalent to a battleship's beam cannons. In addition, it made use of two
                    beam
                    sabers, blades of extremely hot plasma which could cut through any metal with ease. Those beam
                    sabers
                    could be extended into a spear-like beam javelin, which could be used to stab into an enemy from a
                    longer distance.</p>
                <p>The Gundam also used more conventional weaponry; it could launch rockets with a "Hyper Bazooka", the
                    Federation's answer to the bazookas used by Zeon's Zakus; in addition, its head was outfitted with a
                    pair of small vulcan guns, as a way of attacking light-armored aircraft and vehicles without wasting
                    ammo or energy from its more powerful armaments. It also made use of a very unconventional
                    close-range
                    weapon known as the "Gundam Hammer" - a large weapon similar to a flail which could be swung at
                    enemies
                    to deal crushing damage. The Gundam Hammer was eventually upgraded for use in space and outfitted
                    with a
                    number of verniers on the ball, and renamed to be the "Hyper Hammer". Lastly, it wielded a shield
                    which
                    would offer it a defense against enemy attacks that not even its Luna Titanium body could withstand
                    without damage. Gundam pilot, Amuro Ray, would make use of the shield as a decoy in many battles,
                    taking
                    advantage of its size to fool the enemy into thinking he was charging at them, then attacking the
                    enemy
                    through the shield.</p>
                <p>In terms of technology, the Gundam was equipped with a sophisticated Learning Computer which would
                    collect pilot and enemy data during skirmishes and allow the Gundam to operate more effectively. The
                    data from the computer was used by the Federation to improve the controls of the Gundam's
                    mass-produced
                    form, the RGM-79 GM. In addition, it was upgraded by Federation technician Mosque Han shortly before
                    the
                    Battle of A Baoa Qu to improve its reaction times, the joints of the Gundam were given a Magnetic
                    Coating, based on the experimental procedure performed on the RX-78-3 "G-3" Gundam and later used on
                    Amuro's intended successor unit, the RX-78NT-1 Gundam "Alex".</p>
                <p>The Gundam makes use of the Core Block System implemented in the other V Project units. The torso of
                    the
                    Gundam is mostly hollow so that a FF-X7 Core Fighter can dock with it. This allows the pilot to
                    jettison
                    the legs and torso of the Gundam should the machine be too heavily damaged and gives the pilot a
                    chance
                    to escape from battle. Later, during Operation Odessa, the Gundam is given a support unit known as
                    the
                    G-Fighter. The two G-Fighters were designed to take advantage of the Gundam's modular system and
                    diversify the Gundam's role in active combat. These modes ranged from the assault bomber G-Armor to
                    the
                    close combat support tank G-Bull. Officially, it is called a prototype, but it is also said to be
                    more
                    of a custom-made machine that is finished with high quality materials and the best technology.</p>
