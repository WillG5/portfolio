                <p id="firstP">Fatherhood is something that can not be explained with words. When they are around you cant get rid of them, but when they are away you miss them awfully.
                My daughter Marley helps to keep me sane amidst the issues that plague our society with her pure innocence. Running, laughing, watching cat videos, and playing Crash Bandicoot Team racing among a variety of racing games makes the hard times bearable. 
                </p>

                <p>Our daily schedule consist of a routine that implements the way we operated before the outbreak minus me working a lot more to provide.</p>
                <h3>These include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exercising</li>
                    <li>School & Home work</li>
                    <li>Meal Prep</li>
                    <li>Art Projects</li>
                    <li>Mommy Daddy study time(After she is sleep)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>During the lockdown and her school closing I have been spending alot of time with my daughter and in the process
                we have been learning alot about each other and have made many different discoveries about each other and have gotten alot closer.
